I am adding the link in the readme file since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is 460.1 MB. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS. 

Link for the Model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xTwqFQkwFVI6JxZJWDiwf0ov751WoN4l/view?usp=sharing

For executing:
1.downlode the repository and also downlode best_fire_detection_model.pkl file using above link ,make sure that the file should be in same folder along with other components.
2. now execute all cells in jupitor file ,then run app.py. make sure tbat the datasets are there in same folder while executing
